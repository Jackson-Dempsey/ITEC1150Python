""" doctring JACKSON DEMPSEY,  """

## honestly crazy man, this litterally took less than 15 min

##notes, this doesn't match the prompt to an exact extent, but i made my first happy little acident today!
    ##, copying the line : print ("ðŸ¤” ".join([str(x) for x in generatedListInput_fancyPrintStatement])) from a preveious project, i thought i was gonna make a line seperator
    ## turns out the way it's implemented in the code now turns all periods in the text into emojis
    ## absotultely rockin, i'm assusming i could prolly do one of these with just a *liiiiiiiiitle* more effort and overall work
