<h1> ITEC 1150 </h1>

<body> This is a repostiory containing code from an introductory python course take at Minneapolis College. I'm keeping this repository open since it has some intresting things I'd like to demo, from my time learning python.</body>

The main reason this repo is public, is the version of 1150 I took at Minneapolis College is no longer taught. However, similar versions of the 1150 course might be similar

With this said, I have notified ( teachers / tutors ) of this repo's existance, so it will be known what you are doing if you decide to cut and copy this code verbatim.

This goes without saying in any case but, **don't** cheat, *especially* for this. You'll be shooting yourself in the foot before you even start.
