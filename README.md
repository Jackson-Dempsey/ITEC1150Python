<h1> ITEC 1150 </h1>

<body> This is a repostiory containing code from an introductory python course take at Minneapolis College. I'm keeping this repository open since it contains a fair bit of code which might help someone understand the mindset of someone learning python.</body>

here's something else to clear up while you're reading this. the only reason this repo is up is because the version of this course I took at Minneapolis College is no longer taught. However, similar versions of the 1150 course might use the same prompts.

With this said, I have notified ( teachers / tutors ) of this repo's existance, so teachers will know what you are doing if you decide to cut and copy this code verbatim.

This should go without saying but, **don't** cheat, *especially* for this. You'll be shooting yourself in the foot before you even start.
